**An end-to-end Machine Learning engineering project that demonstrates how an ML system evolves from experimentation into a production-ready, containerized, and deployable service.**

</div>



## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the **full lifecycle of a Machine Learning system**, from early experimentation to production-oriented deployment.

Using the **California Housing dataset**, the project focuses on **engineering practices**:

- Reproducible training pipelines
- Explicit separation between training and serving
- Model lifecycle management with MLflow
- Batch and online inference workflows
- Docker-first execution
- Kubernetes-ready architecture



## 🌿 Branch Architecture

This repository is structured as a **progressive learning path**, with each branch representing a stage in ML system maturity.

| Branch | Focus | Key Question |
|------|------|-------------|
| `ml-baseline` | ML experimentation | *How do we explore data and choose a model?* |
| `api-baseline` | Serving fundamentals | *How do we expose a trained model?* |
| `main` | Production MLOps | *How does this become reliable and deployable?* |

The `main` branch represents the **final, production-oriented design**.



## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

The platform implements a Kubernetes-native ML system with:

- **DVC + S3**: Dataset versioning and storage
- **Kubernetes Jobs**: Ephemeral training workloads
- **MLflow (in-cluster)**: Custom image with boto3, psycopg2 dependencies
- **Model Registry**: Alias-based promotion workflows
- **KServe + MLServer**: V2 protocol serving with direct S3 access
- **Separation of concerns**: Control plane (MLflow) vs data plane (S3) vs serving plane (KServe)

### Data Flow

```
DVC (S3) → K8s Training Job → MLflow (K8s) → S3 Artifacts → KServe → V2 Inference
```

1. **DVC** manages dataset versions in S3
2. **Kubernetes Job** pulls data via DVC, executes training
3. **MLflow** (in-cluster) logs experiments and model metadata
4. **S3** stores model artifacts (PyFunc + code + dependencies)
5. **Model Registry** creates version and updates alias
6. **KServe** pulls model from S3 using resolved `storageUri`
7. **MLServer** loads PyFunc model and serves via V2 protocol
